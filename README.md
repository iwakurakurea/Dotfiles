### these dotfiles are reliant on:

`neovim`

[`lovesay.rs`](https://github.com/dotzenith/lovesay.rs)

a terminal with support for a 'patched' nerdfont (`yay nerd font`)

`i3` window manager

`yay -S spotifyd gospt`

`kitty` terminal

`eza` for enhanced `ls`

`ripgrep` to replace `grep` by alias

[`starship`](https://starship.rs/) for the terminal prompt

`tmux` and the third-party plugin [`tpm`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

probably `lua`?
