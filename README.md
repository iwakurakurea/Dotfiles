### these dotfiles are reliant on:

`neovim` and

probably `lua`?

[`lovesay.rs`](https://github.com/dotzenith/lovesay.rs) (clone and build with spaces after hearts)

a terminal with support for a 'patched' nerdfont (`yay nerd font`)

`i3` window manager

`feh` and a `~/.fehrc` file for a desktop background

`~/Scripts/` contains system-dependent settings also executed in i3 config

`dunst` notification daemon

`rofi` application launcher

`yay -S spotifyd gospt` for spotify

`pulseaudio` and `amixer` for audio

`jq` cli json parser

`xclip` for `{cli} | xclip` to copy to clipboard

`kitty` terminal

`eza` for enhanced `ls`

`ripgrep` to replace `grep` by alias

[`starship`](https://starship.rs/) for the terminal prompt

`tmux` and the third-party plugin [`tpm`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
